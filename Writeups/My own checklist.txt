1-> Find a scope 
2-> If its API based then first read documentation (it will surely help you out)
3-> find subdomains (as many subdomains as you can) 
  FOR FINDING SUBDOMAINS ---> (some effective tools from my side)
  a: Assetfinder
  b: Findomain
  c: Amass
  d: Subfinder
  e: Sublist3r
  f: crt.sh
  g: certspotter
  h:  chaos.projectdiscover.io etc

4 -> Find unique and alive subdomains
5 -> screenshot them all
6 -> go to main website and use it like a normal user (do not hunt just capture in burpsuite) and understand the 
program well.

Information Gathering
 Manually explore the site
 Spider/crawl for missed or hidden content
 Check for files that expose content, such as robots.txt, sitemap.xml, .DS_Store
 Check the caches of major search engines for publicly accessible sites
 Check for differences in content based on User Agent (eg, Mobile sites, access as a Search engine Crawler)
 Perform Web Application Fingerprinting
 Identify technologies used
 Identify user roles
 Identify application entry points
 Identify client-side code
 Identify multiple versions/channels (e.g. web, mobile web, mobile app, web services)
 Identify co-hosted and related applications
 Identify all hostnames and ports
 Identify third-party hosted content

7-> If you understand the program better then you are good to go.
  
  Here is some checklists that will help you for finding some low hanging fruites (sometimes p3 or p2)
