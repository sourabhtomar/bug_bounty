HTML injection into emails is dangerous!

    Your users are at risk when a hacker is able to take control of the emails that your applications send, but what's especially dangerous is that the emails will be coming from your company email address.
    When a malicious email comes from your company email, it looks a lot more legitimate.

How to prevent HTML injection into emails:
To stop malicious users from injecting HTML into emails, you can employ the same techniques that you would use to prevent XSS:

        Don't embed user input into emails if you don't have to.
        If you have to embed user input, ALWAYS HTML-encode the user input before embedding it into emails.
        Additionally, you can detect malicious input using regular expressions or other techniques, and reject the request.

Thanks and have a nice day!
